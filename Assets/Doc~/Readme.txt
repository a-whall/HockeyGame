I wrote theses C# scripts:
AudioManager, GoalieAI, Net, Player, PlayerController, RinkTextureGenerator, Stick, about half of game manager

I got some shader code to render the puck while it's behind things from a unity forum,
it's a few lines and simply overwrites the z buffer in a second pass. I also learned basic
blender to create the board mesh and hockey sticks. I learned so much about how physics
works in unity and if I had to remake this project I would do some things differently for sure,
but I'm content with how it turned out.
