I wrote these C# scripts:
AudioManager, GoalieAI, Net, Player, PlayerController, RinkTextureGenerator, Stick, about half of game manager

I got some shader code to render the puck while it's behind things from a unity forum,
it's a few lines and simply overwrites the z buffer in a second pass. I also learned basic
blender to create the board mesh and hockey sticks. I learned so much about how physics
works in unity and if I had to remake this project I would do some things differently for sure,
but I'm content with how it turned out.

Worked primarily in the GameManager script.

I created the UI menu elements and coded the functionality of the UI elements in the GameManager script. This includes main menu, pause menu, settings menu, game difficulty toggles, volume slider, how to play menu, educational mode elements (all on screen stats/info buttons functionality/slider functionality) as well as the educational mode info panels.
